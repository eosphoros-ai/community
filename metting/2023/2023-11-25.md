- DB-GPT Framework AWEL Design Sharing and Discussion
- v0.4.2 Version Release and Subsequent Storage Architecture Discussion
- DB-GPT-Hub Code Standards and SDK
- DB-GPT-Web Playground
- Paper

## Meeting Summary
The community meeting discussed various topics including DB-GPT Framework AWEL design, v0.4.2 version release and storage architecture, DB-GPT-Hub code standards and SDK, DB-GPT-Web Playground, and Paper. Through comprehensive discussions and exchanges, the following conclusions were reached:
- AWEL will serve as the subsequent DB-GPT protocol layer, enabling standard orchestration and expression.
- The entire DB-GPT storage layer needs to be designed with a standardized architecture across metadata, internal data storage, and external data storage, with a particular emphasis on disciplined use of internal metadata.
- The Hub project will incorporate code standards and SDK, and the main project will undergo refactoring, enabling seamless integration among different projects based on a standardized SDK.
- The DB-GPT-Web Playground will be released in November.
- The paper will be published in December.
